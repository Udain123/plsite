      <p class="content">Chelsea won its first major honour, the League Championship, in 1955. The club won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970 and its first European honour, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971. After a period of decline in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club enjoyed a revival in the 1990s and had more success in cup competitions. The past two decades have been the most successful in Chelsea's history: it won five of its six league titles and the UEFA Champions League during this period.[5] Chelsea is one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, and the only London club to have won the Champions League.</p>

It is the home of Chelsea Football Club, which competes in the Premier League, the highest division of English football. The capacity of the stadium is 40,834,[4] making it the ninth largest venue of the 2019–20 Premier League season. The club had plans to expand capacity to 63,000 by the 2023–24 season.

It has undergone major changes over the years, most recently in the 1990s when it was renovated into a modern, all-seater stadium. Stamford Bridge has been a venue for England international matches, FA Cup Finals, FA Cup semi-finals and Charity Shield games.</p>

The season covers the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, but due to the suspension of football due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is extended to August 2020. In 2009, under caretaker manager Guus Hiddink, Chelsea won another FA Cup. In 2009–10, his successor Carlo Ancelotti led them to their first Premier League and FA Cup Double, also becoming the first English top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since 1963. In 2012, Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their seventh FA Cup, and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties, the first London club to win the trophy. The following year the club won the UEFA Europa League, making them the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of five clubs to have won the three main UEFA trophies. Mourinho returned as manager in 2013 and led Chelsea to League Cup success in March 2015, and the Premier League title two months later. Mourinho was sacked after four months of the following season after a poor start. In 2017, under new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea won their sixth English title and the following season won their eighth FA Cup.</p>
