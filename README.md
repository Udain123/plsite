I Udain Srivastava of Computer Science made a site on Premier League. It is a site which is completely made by using HTML and CSS. Its is related to premier league which is a football league in England. This site consist of 6 pages one is Home Page and other 5 are Team Pages, there are many teams but I have only taken top 5 teams. Each page consist of a navigation bar which is made by the help of only CSS properties. The nav on the home page consist of 4 link Home, About, Clubs and Partners and by clicking on the link other than Home link we go to that particular section and when click Home link we will be directed to the Home page. The nav bar which is on the teams pages consist of Home link by clicking on this we will be directed to the Home page, next is About link which on clicking go to the About section, next is the Squad link which on clicking go to the squad section and last is the Players Link which on clicking go the player section. On Home page in clubs section consist of logo of top 5 teams and when we click on the logo we will be directed to that teams page. By using CSS properties I have made my site responsive, it can adjust the things according to the size of the screen. It will be observed when you change the size of the screen.
