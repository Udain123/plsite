      <h1><em>About</em></h1>
      <p class="content">Leicester City Football Club is an English professional football club based in Leicester in the East Midlands. The club competes in the Premier League, the top division of England's football league system, and plays its home matches at the King Power Stadium.The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C., playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football League in 1894 and adopted the name Leicester City in 1919. They moved to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002, which was renamed the King Power Stadium in 2011.</p>

      <p class="content">Leicester won the 2015–16 Premier League, their first top-level football championship. They are one of only seven clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. A number of newspapers described Leicester's title win as the greatest sporting shock ever; multiple bookmakers had never paid out at such long odds for any sport. As a result, the team was dubbed "The Unbelievables", a spin-off harking back to Arsenal's undefeated team "The Invincibles". The club's previous highest finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928–29, then known as the First Division.Throughout their history, Leicester have spent all but one season in the top two divisions of English football. They hold a joint-highest seven second-tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship). The club have been FA Cup finalists four times, won the League Cup three times, and competed in four European campaigns.</p>

        <h2><em>Stadium</em></h2>
        <p class="content">The King Power Stadium (also known as Filbert Way or Leicester City Stadium due to UEFA sponsorship regulations and formerly known as the Walkers Stadium) is a football stadium in Leicester, England. It is the home stadium of Premier League side Leicester City. The all-seater stadium opened in 2002 and has a capacity of 32,261, the 20th largest football ground in England. It is named after travel retail group King Power, a company owned by the club's owners. The stadium was officially opened by former Leicester striker Gary Lineker on 23 July 2002. He used a giant pair of scissors to cut a ribbon on the pitch after arriving at the stadium in a Walkers lorry. The first game at the new stadium was a friendly against Basque team Athletic Bilbao, on 4 August 2002. The game finished 1–1, with Tiko scoring the first goal at the stadium, and Jordan Stewart scoring Leicester's first goal. The attendance was approximately 24,000 (no official figure was recorded due to a computer problem). The first competitive match took place six days later and Leicester beat Watford 2–0 in front of a near-capacity crowd of 31,022.</p>

         <p class="content">This Leichester City squad in Premier League season was initially in top 4 but as the end start approaching after the lockdown, they lost there form and end up at 5th position. The 2019–20 season was Leicester City's 115th in the English football league system and their 52nd (non-consecutive) season in the top tier of English football.[1] This was their sixth consecutive season in the Premier League. They also competed in the FA Cup and EFL Cup. The season covered the period from 1 July 2019 to 26 July 2020. Leicester won the Premier League on 2 May 2016 after Tottenham threw away a 2–0 lead against Chelsea, drawing 2–2 at the "Battle of Stamford Bridge". This completed the fastest seven-year rise to the title except for Ipswich Town in 1962, and Leicester faced a far more unequal top tier than Ipswich did back then. Bookmakers thought Leicester's victory was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,000–1 for it at the start of the season.</p>
